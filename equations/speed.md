The speed of an object is the magnitude of the rate of change of its position with time or the magnitude of the change
of its position per unit of time. It can be thought of as the rate at which
an object covers distance. A fast-moving object has a high speed and covers
a large distance in a given amount of time, while a slow-moving object will cover
a relatively small amount of distance in the same amount of time.

# Units
The speed of an object represents distance divided by time. In the SI, the unit of speed is the meter per second. Other
units of distance and time may be used, such as the commonly used kilometer per hour or miles per hour.

# Alternative definitions
Speed may also be defined as the magnitude of the velocity vector $\bold v$, or the derivative
of position $\bold r$ with respect to time.
$$
v = |\bold v| = |\dot{\bold r}| = |\frac{d\bold r}{dt}|
$$
If $s$ is defined as the length of the path travelled until time $t$, then
speed can also be defined as the time derivative of $s$:
$$
v = \frac{ds}{dt}
$$


# Notation
The equations used here contain the following symbols:

- $v$: Speed of the object.
- $\bold v$: Velocity of the object.
- $\bold r$: Position of the object.
- $d$: Displacement of the object during time $t$.
- $t$: Time spent moving.
- $s$: Distance traveled
